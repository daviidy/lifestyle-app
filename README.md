# lifestyle-app
We had to build a website based on lifestyle articles.
- To use the app, you have to sign in or log in
- Authenticated user:
  - can create articles categories
  - can create articles and link those articles to many categories
  - can comment on article
  - can vote an article
- The homepage shows a featured article (who has the biggest number of votes), and the list of all the categories in order of priority
- The category page show all the articles for a category
- The article page shows the content of an article.

We added also integration tests for authentication and event creation
Run these tests with those commands:

### unit tests
- `rspec spec/user_spec.rb`
- `rspec spec/category_spec.rb`
- `rspec spec/article_spec.rb`
- `rspec spec/vote_spec.rb`
- `rspec spec/organization_spec.rb`

```
group :development, :test do
  gem "database_cleaner"
  gem "rspec-rails"
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
  gem 'rack_session_access'
end

group :test do
